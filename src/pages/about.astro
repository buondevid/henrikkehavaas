				<span class='highlight'>Henrikke Havaas</span>, born in <span class='highlight'>Oslo</span>,
				Norway, is a multidisciplinary artist and sound consultant who weaves her creative vision
				through <span class='highlight'>music</span>, <span class='highlight'>photography</span>,
				and <span class='highlight'>sonic environments</span>. Drawing inspiration from her
				classical piano training at the music conservatoire and her deep connection to nature,
				Henrikke expresses herself as both an artist and a professional sound curator.

				As a <span class='highlight'>DJ</span> performing under the name <span class='highlight'
					>Henrii Havaas</span
				>, she crafts journeys that traverse <span class='highlight'>ambient</span>,
				<span class='highlight'>techno</span>, and euphoric soundscapes. Her sets are a seductive
				fusion of groovy rhythms, playful cuts, <span class='highlight'>hypnotic</span> elements, and
				deep atmospheres. Influenced by meditative experiences, Henrikke approaches DJing as <span
					class='highlight'>painting with sound</span
				>, creating dynamic, storytelling-like mixes unbound by genre. Her performances guide
				listeners through a range of energies, offering opportunities for both transcendence on the
				dance floor and introspection during deep listening sessions.
